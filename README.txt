-left: This cube was made with the provided interpolation shader I like green so I kept that as one of the colors and added red to the other uniform.
-middle: This cube was made with a shiny Phong matirial, it's the one from the tutorial
-right: This is a basic matirial cube with the wireframe setting set to true. I tried something more complex with the grass matirial, but that seams a bit out of my experience level as of right now.
top: I tried for like 3 hours to re-create a lava texture, but I failed and instead just made a strange moving shadow texture by layering two images on top of eachother. The 2nd texture moves around and has z properties that are translucent. I'm still kinda confused about a lot of the parameters. None of the example code explains it.
